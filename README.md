## TMBD Project
Project conducted through the _Digital Futures Academy_.

The aim of the project was to load, clean, analyse and visualise the data taken from The Movie Data Base, in order to practise the EDA skills learned during the Academy. Insights were drawn on the correlation between movie budget and revenue generated, and the nuances in this relationship.
