## TMBD Project
Project conducted through the _Digital Futures Academy_.

The aim of the project was to load, clean, analyse and visualise the data in The Movie Data Base, in order to practise the EDA skills learned during the Academy. Insights were drawn on the correlation between movie budget and revenue generated, and the nuances in this relationship were explored.

_Here's a quick guide on how to navigate this rep:_  

There are three folders:
* Code: Contains one file of python code, detailing the entire EDA process.
* Data: Contains one .csv file on TMBD.
* Visualisations: Contains four images produced in python using seaborn, demonstrating the insights drawn during this project.
